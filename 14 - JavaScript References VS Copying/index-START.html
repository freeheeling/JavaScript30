    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'Sam';
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(team);
    console.log(players);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // it also edits the original array that it references

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice(); //returns entire array
    team2[3] = 'Lux';

    // another way
    const team0 = Array.from(players);
    team0[3] = 'Lux';

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Lux';

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Lux';

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and then we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.age = 99; // changing captain's age to 99, changes person

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99 });
    const cap4 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 40, number: 99});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
    // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    dev.name = 'Wesley';
    console.log(dev); // dev.name = 'Wesley', but wes.name = 'Wes'

    // Object.assign only goes 1 level deep
    // Can't assign new value to twitter for a copy in above example

    // poor man's deepClone
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    dev2.social.twitter = '@boswes'
    // passing object to JSON.stringify returns a string;
    // JSON.parse changes result to object
